I created this project with create-react-app

I installed all web material 2.0 components by running : 
`npm install material-components-web@^6.0.0`

I initialized / modified these files to use the material components in the react app : 

App.js                        (modified)
testingmaterial.js            (initialized)
TestingMaterialComponents.css (initialized)
TestingMaterialComponennts.js (initialized)
